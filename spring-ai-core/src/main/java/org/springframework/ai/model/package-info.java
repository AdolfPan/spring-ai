/**
 * This package contains the core domain for the AI generative models. It includes
 * interfaces that define the aggregate root, entities, and value objects central to the
 * domain-driven design of the generative AI system.
 *
 * The ubiquitous language of AI generation is encapsulated within these interfaces,
 * reflecting the core concepts such as ModelCall (Aggregate Root), ModelResult and
 * ModelResponse (Entities), and ResultMetadata and ModelOptions (Value Objects).
 *
 * This package serves as the foundation for implementing various generative AI models,
 * ensuring a consistent and domain-focused approach in line with DDD principles.
